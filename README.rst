OpenStack Salt
==============

openstack-salt is a project which aims to deploy production environments from source in a way that makes it scalable while also being simple to operate and upgrade.

For an overview of the mission, repositories and related Wiki home page, please see the formal `Home Page`_ for the project.

For those looking to test openstack-salt using an All-In-One (AIO) build, please see the `Quick Start`_ guide.

For more detailed Installation and Operator documentation, please see the `Install Guide`_.

If openstack-salt is missing something you'd like to see included, then we encourage you to see the `Developer Documentation`_ for more details on how you can get involved.

Developers wishing to work on the OpenStack Salt project should always base their work on the lastest Salt code, available from the master GIT repository at `Source`_.

If you have some questions, or would like some assistance with achieving your goals, then please feel free to reach out to us on the
`OpenStack Mailing Lists`_ (particularly openstack-operators or openstack-dev) or on IRC in ``#openstack-salt`` on the `freenode network`_.
